===SETUP===
this is from memory, if you get an error ask me or google it
git init in your folder
git remote set origin {the github link here}
git pull
create token.txt and put in ur login token

===RUNNING===
run the_bot, not any of the files
-b or --bot argument sets the bot to run (console or hangouts, defaults to hangouts)
-i or --id argument sets your user id (console bot only)

===QUICK TOUR===
    the_bot - where all the code goes and also what you run
        rpg - the rpg game
            manager.py
                Manager() - parses commands and calls the appropriate function, also saves and loads data
            classes.py
                Player() - represents a player (probably needs  be refactored soon)
                Stats() - the stats for something, is used by item, enemy, and Player
                Room() - represnts a room
                Enemy() - represents an enemy
                Item() - represents an item
                RPG() - all the main data (items, enemies, users, rooms) goes in here
            save_data.json - the saved data (the game saves every command so it is useful for testing)
        everything else - you proably will not touch it

    token.txt - your hangouts login token
        this is gitignored so no one else can get your token from the repo

===GOOD TO KNOW===
theres a lot of stuff in utils.py, so take a look around
imports are done from insde the_bot no matter where you are(eg import rpg.manager)
file paths are done from outside the_bot no matter where you are (eg open("the_bot/rpg/manager.py"))
the file names and manager are standerdized for all the games, so don't change anything big
there is a change_health method and change_balance method in rpg.stats (use these, don't change it urself)
the console based bot takes way less time to load, so use it for testing (use -b console when running)
the repo has 2 branches, stable_bot(the last fully functional version) and master(what we work on)
DO NOT edit stable_bot, ill deal with updating it
check ur email, there should be an invite to todoist (it has a list of things that need work)
