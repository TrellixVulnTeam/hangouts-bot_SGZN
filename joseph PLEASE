specific things
    - make the prestige stuff a new file
    - get all the old handler stuff out of rpg handler
    - only handler and bot should be able to send stuff to hangouts
        everything else should go through handler (see how i did 2048 for an example)
    - i left u a few comments about variables u never use, plz check if u actually need those

coding style
    - write shorter functions where possible (RPGHandler.atk is too long)
    - use formatted strings instead of concatenating
    - don't mix responsibilities between files and classes
    - if u reuse an expression (like that nonsense for hp in the rpg)
        save it into a variable, then assign that variable to the thing u need to change when ur done
    - don't use except unless u specify an error
    - if u print out an error message, be specific


    picky things that keep popping up in flake8 (optional, but appreciated)
        - spaces around operators, always
            unless its assigning a keyword argument
                yes: function(keyword=value)
                no: function(keyword = value)
        - 

other
    - push whenever it works, pull after u push (this reduces merge conflicts)
