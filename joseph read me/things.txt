TO DO
    joseph u can edit this too. if theres anything in this file u dont find useful, delete it
    - learn git (this is a nice website for basics, i can send u some ebooks too http://think-like-a-git.net/)
    - fix rpg classes


coding style
    - add comments now and then. if u r busy, add it when ur done with a feature
    - dont abbreviate unless its really long, its not worth it

other
    - push whenever whenever u can, pull after u push (this reduces merge conflicts)
