TO DO
    joseph u can edit this too. if theres anything in this file u dont find useful, delete it
    - learn git (this is a nice website for basics, i can send u some ebooks too http://think-like-a-git.net/)
    -  fix economy.py
    - fix rpg classes


coding style
    - don't mix responsibilities between files and classes
    - don't use except unless u specify an error
    - if u print out an error message, be specific
    - add comments now and then. if u r busy, add it when ur done with a feature
    - docstrings are nice too, add those
    - dont abbreviate unless its really long, its not worth it
    - avoid global variables if possible, most things u think should be global can be in a class

other
    - push whenever whenever u can, pull after u push (this reduces merge conflicts)
