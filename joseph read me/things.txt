TO DO
    joseph u can edit this too. if theres anything in this file u dont find useful, delete it
    - learn git (this is a nice website for basics, i can send u some ebooks too http://think-like-a-git.net/)
    -  fix economy.py
    - fix rpg classes


coding style
    - write shorter functions where possible (RPGHandler.atk is too long)
    - use formatted strings instead of concatenating
    - don't mix responsibilities between files and classes
    - if u reuse an expression (like that nonsense for hp in the rpg)
        save it into a variable, then assign that variable to the thing u need to change when ur done
    - don't use except unless u specify an error
    - if u print out an error message, be specific
    - add comments now and then. if u r busy, add it when ur done with a feature
    - docstrings are nice too, add those
    - theres often an obvious way to make things simplier if u use a long if elif chain
    - in classes, there are 4 places variables can go
        - passed in as an argument: things that change each time u call it
        - inside of the class: things which are always the same and/or universal
        - defined in __init__ as an attribute of self: things which are specific to each object
        - defined inside a function: temporary variable u need for that function only
            OR that u also need to pass as an argument to another function
    - dont abbreviate unless its really long, its not worth it
    - avoid global variables if possible, most things u think should be global can be in a class

other
    - push whenever whenever u can, pull after u push (this reduces merge conflicts)
